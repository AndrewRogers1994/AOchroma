# AOchroma

AOchroma is a utility program intended to help Anarchy Online players colourize their chat easily.

## Motivation

This software is part of an initiative to rewrite all useful third-party software written for the video-game Anarchy Online, in order for the community to have up-to-date software that will have less risks of being lost one day.
